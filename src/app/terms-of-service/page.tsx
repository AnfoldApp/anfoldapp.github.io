            4. Subscriptions and Purchases
          </h5>
          <p className="mb-2">
            Anfold is a paid service, and users can access premium features by
            purchasing a monthly subscription (&quot;Subscription&quot; or
            &quot;Subscriptions&quot;) or by buying credits (&quot;Credit&quot;
            or &quot;Credits&quot;). This section outlines the terms and
            conditions related to Subscriptions and Credits.
          </p>

          <h6 className="text-lg font-semibold mb-1">4.1. Payment Terms</h6>
          <p className="mb-2">
            By purchasing a Subscription or Credits, you agree to pay the
            applicable fees and taxes associated with the purchase. You also
            agree to the terms of sale presented to you at the time of purchase.
            All fees are non-refundable except as required by law.
          </p>

          <h6 className="text-lg font-semibold mb-1">4.2. Subscriptions</h6>
          <p className="mb-1">
            Subscriptions allow access to Anfold&apos;s features on a recurring
            basis, billed periodically as agreed upon at the time of purchase.
            It is important to note the following regarding Subscriptions:
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-1 mb-2">
            <li>
              By purchasing a Subscription, you authorize us to automatically
              charge your payment method on each renewal date until you cancel
              the Subscription.
            </li>
            <li>
              The renewal date is typically the same date of each month (or
              another agreed-upon period) corresponding to the date of your
              initial Subscription purchase.
            </li>
            <li>
              If your payment cannot be processed on the renewal date, we may
              suspend your Subscription and restrict access to paid features
              until payment is successfully processed.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h6 className="text-lg font-semibold mb-1">4.3. Credits</h6>
          <p className="mb-1">
            Credits are a form of digital currency used within the Anfold
            platform to access specific features or services. It is important to
            note the following regarding Credits:
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-1 mb-2">
            <li>
              Credits are not legal tender or currency, and they are not
              redeemable, refundable, or exchangeable for any sum of money or
              monetary value.
            </li>
            <li>
              Credits have no equivalent value in fiat currency and do not act
              as a substitute for fiat currency.
            </li>
            <li>
              Credits do not confer upon you any personal property rights, and
              they are non-transferable.
            </li>
            <li>
              Credits may only be used in connection with the applicable Service
              and for the specific purposes they are designated for within the
              Anfold platform.
            </li>
            <li>
              Your available Credits balance may be reviewed in your Anfold
              account. You are solely responsible for verifying that the correct
              amount of Credits has been added to or deducted from your balance.
              Please note that your Credit balance is not a bank account,
              digital wallet, stored value account, or other payment device.
            </li>
            <li>
              We prohibit and do not recognize any purported transfers, sales,
              gifts, or trades of Credits. Any attempt to use, sell, or transfer
              Credits in any manner is a violation of these Terms and may result
              in the revocation, termination, or cancellation of the Credits
              and/or your use of the Services without refund, as well as the
              immediate suspension or termination of your account.

            any time, but your cancellation will take effect at the end of the
            current billing cycle, and you will not receive a refund for any
            unused portion of the Subscription period. If you cancel, you will
